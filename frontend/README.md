A coding challenge given to me, Christopher Lin, by Alicia Riebau.

As its a pretty simple app, I didn't bother with comments.

yarn install

"yarn run test" for the test script "yarn start" to run it

It was made with create react app and only dependency is Jest

Has around 70-80% testing coverage.

I actually enjoyed this test. About me I am a full stack developer. I prefer front because I like styling. However I realized after starting this test it was totally focused on TDD, regex and recursion... so I focused on those and didn't bother styling.

Weather you decide to move forward or not with my application, please some feedback on the code would be appreciated. christoff123@gmail.com Christopher Lin

Thanks! It was a positive experience. I enjoyed this code test.
